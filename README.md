The staging area in Git is a space where file changes are prepared before committing.

It lets you select specific updates you want to include instead of committing all modified files.

You add changes to the staging area using commands like git add filename or git add ..

This area helps maintain a clean and meaningful commit history by grouping related changes.

Developers can review updates before finalizing them in a commit.

The staging area works between the working directory and the repository.

It ensures accuracy, better organization, and more control over version tracking.
